# warning
code is probably messy, so don't wonder why it maybe isn't working

I would recommend recoding this project with my template

# how to set it up
first install the modules (install.bat)

then replace "your-webhook" with your webhook

compile it/make the code secure/make it unreadable for humans

send it to people who wanna mass check tokens

enjoy

# information
their ip will be used to check the tokens (and probably get flagged after some time), so don't worry :]

**I won't update this project.**
